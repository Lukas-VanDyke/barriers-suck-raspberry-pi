This game uses a snes controller as the input device.

Additions beyond assignment specifications: 
- Pressing L Trigger + R Trigger activates a 'cheat' mode which will allow the player's unit to move and shoot but will freeze enemy units and bullets. The player can then kill units as they are stationary. They can also shoot at stationary bullets. (When a player's bullet collides with an enemy bullet, the enemy bullet is destroyed.)

Assignment requirements can be found in the pdf file.
